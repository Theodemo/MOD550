    "If the cookie is replaced and the bowl contents don’t change, why does the posterior change after the second draw?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Core Idea: Bayesian Updating & Sequential Learning**  \n",
    "Even though the contents of the bowl remain unchanged, **our belief about which bowl we are drawing from changes** after each observation. This is the essence of **Bayesian updating**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Breaking it Down Step by Step**\n",
    "1. **Before drawing any cookies**, we start with a **prior**:  \n",
    "   $$ P(B_1) = 0.5, \\quad P(B_2) = 0.5 $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **After the first draw (vanilla cookie)**:\n",
    "   - We update our beliefs using Bayes’ Rule.\n",
    "   - The posterior probability changes to:\n",
    "     $$ P(B_1 | V) = 0.6, \\quad P(B_2 | V) = 0.4 $$\n",
    "   - This updated **posterior** is now our new belief about which bowl we are drawing from.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Before the second draw**:\n",
    "   - We do not reset our belief back to the original **prior**. Instead, we treat the updated **posterior** from step 2 as our new prior.\n",
    "   - This reflects that we now have **one piece of evidence** that influences our expectations for future draws.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Second draw (also vanilla)**:\n",
    "   - Since our belief has already been adjusted by the first observation, the second observation **further refines** our belief.\n",
    "   - We apply Bayesian updating **again**, using the previous posterior as the new prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Takeaway**\n",
    "- Even though the bowl contents stay the same, our belief about which bowl we are drawing from **does not reset** after each draw.\n",
    "- Each draw provides additional **evidence**, leading to a **progressively stronger belief** that we are drawing from Bowl 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use a `Pmf` to solve the cookie problem and the dice problem, which we saw in the previous chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- With a `Pmf` it is easy to perform sequential updates with multiple pieces of data.\n",
    "\n",
