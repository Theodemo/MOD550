# Assignment Overview

**Deadline:** 4th February

## Tasks

1. **Construct a Class to Generate a 2D Dataset:**
   - Create a class capable of generating a 2D dataset.

2. **Dataset Generation:**
   - The dataset can be:
     - 2D random data,
     - Noise around a function,
     - Your own truth (not a line).
   
3. **Combine Datasets:**
   - Use the classes created earlier to generate two datasets and append one dataset to the other.

4. **Save the Data and Plots:**
   - Write the data to a file.
   - Save the plots of the data.

5. **Save the Metadata:**
   - Ensure that you save the metadata of the dataset.
   - If not, create a dedicated file with information about your data.

6. **Version Control via Git:**
   - Save the dataset using Git.
   - Import datasets from a fellow student or from an open 2D dataset.

7. **Metadata for Imported Data:**
   - Generate and integrate the metadata file for the imported data.
   - State your assumptions about the origin of the truth in the source data.

8. **Regression on Imported Data (Bonus):**
   - Perform regression on the imported dataset.

9. **Assessment of Git Repositories:**
   - Select 3 GitHub/GitLab repositories.
   - Make an assessment of the coding standards used in these repositories.

## Delivery Instructions

1. **Create a Public GitHub Repository:**
   - Make sure I have access to your GitHub repository.

2. **Folder Structure:**
   - Add a folder called `MOD550/data` to store the outcome of your library.
   - Add a folder called `MOD550/code` to upload your code in `.py` format.

3. **File Naming:**
   - Name your Python program `exercise_1.py`.
   - The output of your program should be:
     - A text file for point 8 of the assignment.
     - A plot for point 7, showing the imported data and the assumed model.

4. **Execution of the Program:**
   - I should be able to download your program and execute it using a script.
   - Ensure the naming is precise.

## Notes

- Ensure that you save both the dataset and the associated metadata.
- The metadata should include information about the dataset's source, assumptions, and any other relevant context.
- When selecting the GitHub repositories to assess, focus on coding standards like structure, clarity, and documentation.
